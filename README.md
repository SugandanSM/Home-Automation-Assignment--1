# Home-Automation-Assignment--1
 Objective:-
 
    To make a home automation using  one or more sensors using Tinkercad.
 
 Components Used:-
 
     • PIR Sensor
     
     • Temperature Sensor[TMP36]
     
     • Arduino Uno R3
     
     • 100 Ω Resistor
     
     • Yellow LED
     
     • Red LED
     
Working:-

 A PIRsensor and Temperature sensor are connected to the ArduinoBoard.When a object is in motion the PIRsensor detects and pass the signal to the board where LED is connected starts Glowing. And temperature  sensor detects the room temperature if the temperature crosses 25'(celsius) then another LED which is connected to the board starts glow due to the signal from Temperature sensor.
 
 Applications:-
 
 • Used in Buglar alarms
 
 • Used in Automatic AirConditoner
